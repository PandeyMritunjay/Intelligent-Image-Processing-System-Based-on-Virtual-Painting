# Intelligent-Image-Processing-System-Based-on-Virtual-Painting
The "AI-Virtual-Painter" program allows users to draw on their screen by tracking the index finger's movement in real-time. It features color selection and erasing by detecting gestures with the index and middle fingers, using OpenCV and MediaPipe for hand tracking.

# Guidelines:
- Use your index and middle finger to activate Selection Mode and choose from various colors or the eraser at the top of the screen.
- Adjust the thickness of the draw using the distance between your thumb and index finger, selecting the desired size when the pinky finger is up.
- Clear the screen simply by closing your hand.
- Enter in Stand by Mode using only your index and pinky finger (indicated by a line between these 2 fingers). This mode is useful when you want to draw separate things on the screen.
